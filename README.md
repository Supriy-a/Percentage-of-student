Prediction Using Supervised Machine learning(Level- Beginner)
Task -1st # Simple Linear Regression
Predict the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours
This is a simple linear regression task as it involved two variables
Importing all libraries required in this notebook
Reading the data from the given file

Step 3 - Data Preprocessing
Step 4 - Model Training
Step 5 - Plotting the Line of regression
Step 6 - Making Predictions
Now that we have trained our algorithm, it's time to test the model by making some predictions.

For this we will use our test-set data
Step 7 - Comparing Actual result to the Predicted Model result
Step 8 - Evaluating the model
The final step is to evaluate the performance of algorithm. This step is particularly important to compare how well different algorithms perform on a particular dataset. 
Here different errors have been calculated to compare the model performance and predict the accuracy
